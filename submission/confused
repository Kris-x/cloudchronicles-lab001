Here’s a STAR-based disaster recovery plan for a Google Cloud outage in the us-central1 region, using Cloud SQL replicas, multi-region Cloud Storage, and Pub/Sub alerts.

Situation
A regional outage in us-central1 has disrupted services, affecting databases, storage access, and messaging queues. Applications hosted in this region are experiencing downtime.

Task
Ensure business continuity by implementing a failover strategy that restores services quickly while minimizing data loss.

Action
Database Failover (Cloud SQL Replicas)

Prevention:

Deploy read replicas in us-east1 and us-west1.

Set up automated backups for recovery.

Failover:

Promote a replica in us-east1 or us-west1 as the new primary instance.

Update connection strings and use Cloud SQL Proxy to reroute traffic.

Storage Redundancy (Multi-Region Cloud Storage)

Prevention:

Store critical data in multi-region buckets (nam4 for North America).

Failover:

Applications automatically retrieve data from alternative storage locations without requiring manual intervention.

Messaging & Alerts (Pub/Sub & Monitoring)

Prevention:

Distribute Pub/Sub topics across multiple regions.

Failover:

Clients connect to Pub/Sub instances in backup regions (us-east1, us-west1).

Cloud Monitoring triggers alerts notifying teams of service disruptions and recovery actions.

Traffic Management (Cloud Load Balancer & DNS Failover)

Prevention:

Use a Global HTTP(S) Load Balancer to distribute traffic across multiple regions.

Failover:

Traffic shifts automatically to healthy instances.

Cloud DNS updates service IPs with low TTL values for rapid redirection.

Result
✅ Databases remain operational using Cloud SQL replicas. ✅ Storage access is uninterrupted via multi-region Cloud Storage. ✅ Messaging continues using Pub/Sub failover mechanisms. ✅ Traffic is rerouted with load balancing and DNS failover.
